# Floating-Point-Systolic-Array

This study presents the design and simulation of an 8x8 systolic array for performing matrix multiplication with 32-bit floating point numbers. Leveraging parallelism and pipelining, the array efficiently processes subsets of input matrices, propagating partial products along rows and columns. Through Verilog hardware description languages and industry-standard simulation tools (Vivado), we simulate the systolic array with a test bench.
